bot_says: ["There are many reasons people may overshare, its often comes from
a desire to connect to people, when maybe they feel lonely or it could be that a person
comes from a family when oversharing is encouraged. Another reason people overshare is  
because people want to avoid awkward silence and they will do anything to avoid it. But 
through many studies it appears that using social media could lead to oversharing" ],

bot_says: ["You've probably been at work and seen many incidents of people discussing marital issues with your colleagues", 
"This is an example of oversharing", "How and why someone shares offline is something to delve into because many people only
look at social media being the reason why many people overshare","We are going to be touching of 3 of the biggest reasons why", 
"One reason is because you might feel a false sense of intimacy, this might be why you've seen soo many hairdresser scene in filmas
of customers discussing their boyfriend/husbands problems because when they are cutting yout hair or maybe painting your nails it
creates that false sense.You may not even know hairdresser's name but they're in your personal space,many people see that gives them
the permission to start talking as if it was their partner or close friend", 
	    
"Another reason is a person finds solace in a stranger, some people can easily share intimate details to a complete stranger. You have
no relationship with the stranger, so theres no reason for them to judge you and he or she does it doen;t matter because you will probably never 
them again. Talking to a stranger is like a cheaper option to therapy",
	    
"A person may also have a poor boundaries, some oversharers can sometimes lack boundaries. So they don't know that telling their 
work colleague that their husband is bad in bed is not appropriate or even revealing finanicial struggles to total strangers. When 
lacking boundaries it can cause a problem when building close relationships as a result the oversharer loses confidence about who 
is interested in hearing about their daily issues "],

bot_says: ["When using social media too much it lead to oversharing, a few reasons that people may share too much online", 
	    
"Social media invite users to share everything about their lives, it's so easy to post an life update, a video, an event which
just a click of a button. This can lead to the fear of missing out this leads to the feeling that people are doing things without
you or that things are passing you by. Social media makes you think that oversharing is being authentic, using a platform to air
out personal details can have some big consequences"
	    
"To vent emotions and stress, i guarentee we probably all seen a facebook rent once in our life time and this is because social
media gives everyone a voice and the platform to express it. Also to let our their frustrations according to the article Oversharing: Why Do We Do It and How Do We Stop?
from the Huffngton Post" 'oversharing is fueled by out insecurites', people care too much what others think about them and try to change
how people see them. This leads to oversharing too much info"
	    
"Some people just want to 15 minutes of fame, to get that more likes, comments and shares they present their lives better
than their life normally is so it can appear extranvagant so they can get noticed even if its too much",
