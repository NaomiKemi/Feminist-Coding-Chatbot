bot_says: ["There are many reasons people may overshare, its often comes from
a desire to connect to people, when maybe they feel lonely or it could be that a person
comes from a family when oversharing is encouraged. Another reason people overshare is  
because people want to avoid awkward silence and they will do anything to avoid it. But 
through many studies it appears that using social media could lead to oversharing" ],

bot_says: ["You've probably been at work and seen many incidents of people discussing marital issues with your colleagues", 
"This is an example of oversharing", "How and why someone shares offline is something to delve into because many people only
look at social media being the reason why many people overshare","We are going to be touching of 3 of the biggest reasons why", 
"One reason is because you might feel a false sense of intimacy, this might be why you've seen soo many hairdresser scene in filmas
of customers discussing their boyfriend/husbands problems because when they are cutting yout hair or maybe painting your nails it
creates that false sense.You may not even know hairdresser's name but they're in your personal space,many people see that gives them
the permission to start talking as if it was their partner or close friend", 
	    
"Another reason is a person finds solace in a stranger, some people can easily share intimate details to a complete stranger. You have
no relationship with the stranger, so theres no reason for them to judge you and he or she does it doen;t matter because you will probably never 
them again. Talking to a stranger is like a cheaper option to therapy",
	    
"A person may also have a poor boundaries, some oversharers can sometimes lack boundaries. So they don't know that telling their 
work colleague that their husband is bad in bed is not appropriate or even revealing finanicial struggles to total strangers. When 
lacking boundaries it can cause a problem when building close relationships as a result the oversharer loses confidence about who 
is interested in hearing about their daily issues "],

"Social media invite users to share everything about their lives, it's so easy to post an life update, a video, an event which
just a click of a button. This can lead to the fear of missing out this leads to the feeling that people are doing things without
you or that things are passing you by. Social media makes you think that oversharing is being authentic, using a platform to air
out personal details can have some big consequences"
	    
"To vent emotions and stress, i guarentee we probably all seen a facebook rent once in our life time and this is because social
media gives everyone a voice and the platform to express it. Also to let our their frustrations according to the article Oversharing: Why Do We Do It and How Do We Stop?
from the Huffngton Post" 'oversharing is fueled by out insecurites', people care too much what others think about them and try to change
how people see them. This leads to oversharing too much info"

expect change overnight. As with any other areas of personal development, there will be setbacks -
so you need to have patience with yourself. Figuring out a time and place to overshare and understanding
the effects on your mental health is quite useful in helping to overcome oversharing but the first
steo is learning what are your triggers and how you stop yourself. One in portant thing is noticing 
someones body language, this is a great social skill but also is a way to notice if maybe what you 
said isn't appropriate"],

bot_says: ["After all this you may be thinking is oversharing that bad or wondering why it has a bad
rep. Many people make a living on oversharing like reality TV show stars such as the kardashians, influencers
and YouTube vloggers. I know we all love looking into other people's life but many of these stars 
crave for some privacy when the camera's are off but many peeople believe like paparazzi don't believe
so as they've share so much of themselves with the public through a screen. Oversharing can be a powerful
tool when used right as it can help you to open up and connect with similar indiviuals, sharring your struggles
can be met with some suuport. Maybe social media could be use as a supportive tool rather than a place
to ridicule others in their times of struggle"],
