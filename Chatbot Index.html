    <h1> Chatbot</h1>
        <P>Sharing to much with people, friends or even social media? It can be hard to 
          know what parts of your life to share or who you can trust with certain bits of information. 
          I never had advice on these things, I had to learn the hard way. I was a victim of oversharing
          way too much information that I wish I didn't. Through this chatbot I can be able to help you, 
          the user understand how to treasure your moments and live a happier private life.
        </P>
        <P>This chatbot is something that should be seen as an advisor and something you can learn from.
          Many people can learn from other peoples experiences so I don't mimd being the lab rat.If you feel 
          like you overshare, please note that a lot of people do and due to the vast growth of many social 
          platforms like Tiktok and instagram people feel more inclined to be more open and vulnerable with 
          strangers on the internet. Maybe this chatbot can help you and help me learn how to better cherish 
          my private moments in life.
        </P>
        <p>
          Oversharing can feel good in the moment, but can have massive consequences. People tend to overshare 
          for many reasons, Oversharing is described as “revealing an inappropriate amount of detail about one's personal life” -
         and Dr Kirren Schnack, a clinical psychologist from Oxford. It helps to recognise if you have real intention of 
         oversharing and the root cause and you have started to recognise it but using this bot.
