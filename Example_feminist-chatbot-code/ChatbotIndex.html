    bot_says: ["This is an example of oversharing,How and why someone shares offline is something to delve into because many people only look at social media as the reason why many people overshare We are going to be touching of 3 of the biggest reasons why and You've probably been at work and seen many incidents of people discussing marital issues with your colleagues", 
"One explanation is that you could get a false sense of intimacy. This may explain why you've seen so many hairdresser scenes in movies where customers talk about their boyfriends' or spouses' difficulties since it fosters that impression when they are cutting your hair or perhaps painting your nails. Many people believe that because the hairdresser is in their personal space and you may not even know their name, they have licence to start speaking to you as though they were their lover or close friend.", 
	    
"Another factor is that some people find comfort in strangers and are willing to divulge private information to them. Since you don't know the stranger, they have no right to judge you, and even if they do, it won't matter because you're unlikely to see them again. Similar to a less expensive form of therapy, talking to a stranger",
	    
" A person could also have weak limits; oversharers occasionally exhibit a lack of boundaries. Therefore, women are unaware that it is improper to inform a coworker about their husband's terrible behaviour in bed or even to disclose financial troubles to complete strangers. Lack of boundaries can be problematic for forming close bonds since the oversharer loses faith in their ability to find listeners for their daily woes."],

Lack of boundaries can make it difficult to form close bonds since the oversharer becomes unsure of who wants to hear about their problems on a daily basis.",
	              "Because social media offers everyone a voice and a place to express themselves, I guarantee that we have all seen a Facebook rant at some point in our lives. According to the article Oversharing: Why Do We Do It and How Do We Stop?, people also share their frustrations. According to the Huffington Post, 'oversharing is fueled by our insecurities' as people strive to modify how other people perceive them out of an excessive concern for what others think of them. This encourages excessive information sharing.",

First, ask questions to give the other person room to talk about themselves. Second, speak more slowly when you do. Take a deep breath before responding to a query.

Tip 1: If you suspect you might be oversharing via text or an online post, hold off on pressing 'send' until you can read the message with clarity. You can also ask a friend if they think you are oversharing. Tip 2: Avoid posting when you're upset. Anger might lead you to say things you wouldn't normally say, and if you publish something inappropriate, it could stick with you for a very long time. Tip: If you want to submit a rant in a fit of wrath, DON'T. Tip: Be careful while posting on social media.

Understanding when and when you overshare, as well as the effects it has on your mental health, can be very helpful in overcoming oversharing, but the first step is figuring out your triggers and how to stop yourself. Observing someone's body language is important because it's a terrific social skill and a means to determine whether or not what you said was suitable."],

I know we all enjoy peeking into other people's lives, but many of these celebrities want for some privacy when the cameras aren't rolling. However, many people think that because they have exposed so much of themselves to the public via a screen, paparazzi don't really believe that.
