<h1> About the Project </h1>
    <P>
        Before this project, I couldn't define the word feminism. But through building my project I found the true meaning of the word, 
        and this gave me the inspiration for my project. This project is based on the world now and how people tend to overshare. Me myself, 
        I tend to normally overshare private things about myself and then regret it once I've said it. In this 21st century, people use social 
        media as an outlet to discuss their problems, and maybe even special moments allowing the whole world to chime in, but when do you cap this? 
        how do you know this information is a bit too private for everyone to know?
    </P>

    <P>
        This project wants to provide ways to help understand the importance of not sharing every moment, every feeling, and every thought. 
        Some things are meant for you and your ears only. You can write your own story without anyone's opinion causing you to change your mind or to feel deflated. 
        As the chatbot is scripted and the user cannot ask any questions, but the bot does provide the options of topics they have problems with when it comes to oversharing. 
        However, the website does provide more information on how to keep a private life, so if the user is trying to find a better understanding, they can access more information
        through the help provided.
    </P>
    <p>
        In this project, I am just trying to help those that may have a hard time deciding what to share and what not to share. I've been through so many unfortunate moments where 
        I've overshared, and it has caused me distress and I just wanted to curl up into a ball. But over time I have learned, and I would love to share that with the user. And this 
        is where feminism ties into it, because people deem females as big gossipers; because people believe that we are wired to do so much more than men. I want to break that notion 
        as everyone has maybe shared a bit too much at one period of their life and looks back now wishing they didn't. Feminism is all about challenging restrictive gender norms and 
        all genders having equal rights and opportunities.

    <P>This project has been developed with the guidance and support of Florence, Jo and Mahalia. Each lecturer helped me with different areas of my project,
        with Jo, it was the coding aspect, you provide endless resources to help me better my coding skills. Mahalia , you helped me understand interactions 
        and my control as a user myself. And finally, Florence, you further understand what my bot can achieve through mind mapping and open discussions. 
        Thanks you to all my classmates, especially Timmy, Jane and Wen for helping make my classes more enjoyable.

    <P>This project is about privacy and cherishing private moments without feeling the need to share with everyone, especially on social media platforms.
        “A simple, private life, is a happy life. Everything you do doesn't need to be seen or heard by others for acceptance” A lovely quote that I found 
        by @al.khaafidh that sums up why I chose this topic of private life as my base for my chatbot.
    </P>
    <p>
        The build of this website is mainly on bootstrap as I used it to develop all the content of the website, expect for my chatbot. My index page took 
        much code from this bootstrap example https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/cover/. This site used nude colours to bring more life to the word 
        “private” as I believe many people think of black or other dark colours when they think of that word. So instead of black, I used nude shades, 
        so people can see that the word “private” can also have good things attached to it. The fonts that were used weren't too harsh and I believe it fit 
        with the style of the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chatbot was developed with by a code that was provided by Jo, which I will attach here:at:https://github.com/katiemhughes/feminist-chatbot.
        This project wouldn't be able to work without the code Jo provide and the information that was provided by bootstrap. The code for this project 
        is publicly available at:https://github.com/NaomiKemi/Feminist-Coding-Chatbot
