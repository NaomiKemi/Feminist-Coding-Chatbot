               <p> In this book, the author explores the phenomenon of people communicating with one another 
                via computer or smartphone screens. Texting, social media, online dating, and other technologies 
                are viewed as oversharing tools, which the author feels blurs the border between one's private 
                and public life. The book looks at how one portrays themselves, and we need to be more open about 
                things that were once private. Another chapter includes examples of when the private should be made 
                public and employment losses as a result of oversharing.

               <p> In his comedy routine, Shawn Hitchins assures that everyone will experience the A-ha moment that Oprah 
                has been telling us about. In this first collection of writings, he examines his irreverent temperament 
                and is unafraid to discuss either his mistakes or modest triumphs. For the enjoyment of the audience, 
                he opens this up in this collection.

               <p> Maggie Kelly describes why she established her own blog in this book. And it was to keep the frustration 
                from blowing out of her head. She's tired of being a stay-at-home mom and feels held captive by her marriage, 
                which is the main factor. She is then advised by a buddy to start an anonymous blog so she can moan to her heart's 
                content without feeling condemned. Nevertheless, her spouse later learns about the blog and is embarrassed.
